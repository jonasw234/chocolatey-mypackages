# Attention
Doing work manually when it can be automated can hardly be called efficient.  I’ve therefore migrated my packages to use the Chocolatey Automatic Updater (AU).  You can find the new repository here: https://github.com/jonasw234/au-packages

# Purpose
Chocolatey packages for some more awesome software that didn’t have packages yet.
